This is my first blog post on this new website!  
I am extremely excited about it.

Hopefully, I will not be lazy and forget about this page in a few days. As the name suggests, this page will be primarily a technology blog page. Actually STEM, not only technology. 

Currently, my interests in STEM are mostly around physics, electronics, programming, and CTF competitions. Stay tuned for the interesting things that are coming soon!
